# Chatbot_with_Tensorflow

A chatbot using Tensorflow 1.0.0. A Deep Natural Language Processing model named Seq2Seq is implemented.
Several stacked Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used to create this DNLP model.

***Please Note since my machine does not have significant processing power, it took several days (3 days) for the model to 
train.***

The code chatbot_tuned.py is heavily commented to help understand each step. 
The massive datasets used for creating the bot is also attached. 
The data set comprises of movie conversations between characters. 

The solution is broken down into several parts: 
1) Data Preprocessing
2) Building the Seq2Seq Model
3) Training the Seq2Seq Model
4) Testing the Seq2Seq Model

This chatbot can be used for your website or application. Enjoy! :) 
Feel free to play around with the hyperparameters to enjoy a conversation with the chatbot.
