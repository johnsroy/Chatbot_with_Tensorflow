# Chatbot with Tensorflow 2
Chatbots are one of the most useful and real life use cases of AI.

A chatbot using Tensorflow 1.0.0. A Deep Natural Language Processing model named Seq2Seq is implemented.
Several stacked Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used to create this DNLP model.

***Please Note since my machine does not have significant processing power, it took several days (3 days) for the model to 
train.***

The code chatbot_tuned.py is heavily commented to help understand each step. 
The massive datasets used for creating the bot is also attached. 
The data set comprises of movie conversations between characters. 

The solution is broken down into several parts: 
1) Data Preprocessing
2) Building the Seq2Seq Model
3) Training the Seq2Seq Model
4) Testing the Seq2Seq Model

This chatbot can be used for your website or application. Enjoy! :) 
Feel free to play around with the hyperparameters to enjoy a conversation with the chatbot.

To reproduce this code: 
Make sure that Tensorflow 1.0.0 is installed
Python version 3.5 or above
You are inside an Anaconda environment and using Spyder

***DATASET:***

Dataset has been downloaded from the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus.
The corpus contains a metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts:

- 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters
- involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies
- in total 304,713 utterances
- movie metadata included:
	- genres
	- release year
	- IMDB rating
	- number of IMDB votes
	- IMDB rating
- character metadata included:
	- gender (for 3,774 characters)
	- position on movie credits (3,321 characters)
 
File Description:
- movie_lines.txt
	- contains the actual text of each utterance
	- fields:
		- lineID
		- characterID (who uttered this phrase)
		- movieID
		- character name
		- text of the utterance

- movie_conversations.txt
	- the structure of the conversations
	- fields
		- characterID of the first character involved in the conversation
		- characterID of the second character involved in the conversation
		- movieID of the movie in which the conversation occurred
		- list of the utterances that make the conversation, in chronological 
			order: ['lineID1','lineID2',â€¦,'lineIDN']
			has to be matched with movie_lines.txt to reconstruct the actual content
